## Build Information
- Android Build Status: Successful (3.1.0-INDEV)
- Desktop Build Status: Not tested (not needed at this time)
- Installation Method: Manual transfer to device (ADB install had issues)
- Verification: APK installed and launched successfully

## Project Goals
- Primary Goal: Understand game architecture for productivity integration
- Secondary Goal: Create debug tools to observe game behavior
- Long-term Vision: Integrate productivity features using game mechanics
- Conceptual Direction: Transform task management into an RPG experience

## Code Assessment
- Core Game Logic: Dungeon.java (manages game state, levels, and progression)
- Game Settings: SPDSettings.java (handles config, preferences, and options)
