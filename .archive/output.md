Summary of Gradle Build Output for Shattered Pixel Dungeon
Overview
The Gradle build process for the Shattered Pixel Dungeon project, run on June 2, 2025, at 06:38 PM PDT, attempted to build all modules (android, core, desktop, ios, services, SPD-classes, services:news, services:updates, etc.) but failed due to a missing Android SDK configuration. The build was executed in the project directory D:\Projects\shattered-pixel-dungeon\shattered-pixel-dungeon using Gradle 8.10.2.
Build Process

Projects Evaluated:
Gradle evaluated multiple modules: android, core, desktop, ios, services, SPD-classes, services:news, services:updates, services:news:debugNews, services:news:shatteredNews, services:updates:debugUpdates, and services:updates:githubUpdates.
Each module's build.gradle file was processed from the respective subdirectories.


Dependency Transformations:
Dependencies for the desktop and ios modules were transformed using InstrumentationAnalysisTransform, MergeInstrumentationAnalysisTransform, and ExternalDependencyInstrumentingArtifactTransform.
Transformed libraries included:
desktop: badass-runtime-plugin-1.12.7.jar, slf4j-api-1.7.25.jar, asm-9.1.jar, and related ASM libraries.
ios: robovm-gradle-plugin-2.3.21.jar, commons-compress-1.22.jar, robovm-compiler-2.3.21.jar, maven-aether-provider-3.0.4.jar, and others for RoboVM and Maven.




Build Duration: The process ran for 1 minute and 2 seconds before failing.

Error Details

Error Message:Could not determine the dependencies of task ':android:compileDebugJavaWithJavac'.
> SDK location not found. Define a valid SDK location with an ANDROID_HOME environment variable or by setting the sdk.dir path in your project's local properties file at 'D:\Projects\shattered-pixel-dungeon\shattered-pixel-dungeon\local.properties'.


Cause: The Android SDK location was not properly configured, preventing the android:compileDebugJavaWithJavac task from resolving dependencies.
Context: Despite the user setting the ANDROID_HOME environment variable (as confirmed in prior conversation), the build still failed, suggesting a potential issue with the variable’s path or its recognition by Gradle.

Additional Notes

Deprecated Features: The build used deprecated Gradle features, making it incompatible with Gradle 9.0. Users can run ./gradlew build --warning-mode all to identify specific deprecations.
Stack Trace: The error originated from com.android.builder.errors.EvalIssueException in the Android Gradle plugin, specifically in SdkLocator.kt, indicating a failure to locate the SDK.
Watched Directories: No directory hierarchies were watched during the build.

Recommended Actions

Verify ANDROID_HOME:
Confirm the ANDROID_HOME variable points to a valid Android SDK path (e.g., C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk).
In PowerShell, run:echo $Env:ANDROID_HOME


Ensure the path contains the SDK tools and the required API level (e.g., API 33 or 34, as specified in android/build.gradle).


Create/Update local.properties:
In the project root (D:\Projects\shattered-pixel-dungeon\shattered-pixel-dungeon), create or edit local.properties with:sdk.dir=C:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk


Use double backslashes for Windows paths.


Retry Build:
Run:./gradlew build


For detailed logs:./gradlew build --debug --scan




Desktop-Only Build (if Android is not needed):
To avoid Android SDK issues, build only the desktop module:./gradlew desktop:build


Run the desktop version:./gradlew desktop:run




Check Android SDK Installation:
Open Android Studio, go to SDK Manager (File > Settings > Appearance & Behavior > System Settings > Android SDK), and ensure the required SDK platforms and build tools are installed.


Clear Gradle Cache (if issues persist):
Run:./gradlew cleanBuildCache


Then retry the build.

Notes

The project’s multi-platform nature (desktop, Android, iOS) requires specific configurations for each module. The desktop module is simpler to build if Android development is not required.
If the issue persists after verifying ANDROID_HOME and local.properties, check for typos in the SDK path or ensure the Android SDK includes the correct build tools and API levels.
