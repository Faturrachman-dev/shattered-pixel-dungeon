# ISOLATION-FOCUSED MEMORY BANK SYSTEM (AI Instructions)

> **TL;DR:** This is the main entry rule. It ensures Memory Bank is set up and then typically transitions to VAN mode to start project analysis.

## ‚öôÔ∏è AI ACTIONS - SYSTEM STARTUP:

1.  **Acknowledge System Start:**
    a.  State: "Memory Bank System initiated. Performing mandatory Memory Bank verification."
2.  **CRITICAL: Memory Bank Verification & Setup:**
    a.  `fetch_rules` to load and follow `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Core/file-verification.mdc`.
    b.  This rule will guide you to check if `memory-bank/` and its core subdirectories/files exist. If not, it will instruct you to create them using `run_terminal_cmd` for directories and `edit_file` for initial file content.
    c.  **If `Core/file-verification.mdc` reports critical failure (e.g., cannot create `memory-bank/`):**
        i.  State: "üö® CRITICAL ERROR: Memory Bank structure could not be verified or created. Cannot proceed with CMB workflow. Please check permissions or manually create the `memory-bank/` directory."
        ii. Await user intervention. Do not proceed.
    d.  **If verification/creation is successful:**
        i.  State: "Memory Bank structure verified/initialized successfully."
3.  **Transition to VAN Mode (Default Initial Mode):**
    a.  State: "Transitioning to VAN mode for initial project analysis and complexity determination."
    b.  `fetch_rules` to load and follow `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/visual-maps/van_mode_split/van-mode-map.mdc`.
    c.  (The `van-mode-map.mdc` will then orchestrate the VAN mode process).

## üß≠ MODE-SPECIFIC VISUAL MAPS (For AI's Conceptual Understanding)
The CMB system uses distinct orchestrator rules for each mode. You will be directed to `fetch_rules` for these as needed:
-   VAN Mode: `visual-maps/van_mode_split/van-mode-map.mdc` (Initial Analysis & Complexity)
-   PLAN Mode: `visual-maps/plan-mode-map.mdc` (Task Planning)
-   CREATIVE Mode: `visual-maps/creative-mode-map.mdc` (Design Decisions)
-   IMPLEMENT Mode: `visual-maps/implement-mode-map.mdc` (Code Implementation)
-   REFLECT Mode: `visual-maps/reflect-mode-map.mdc` (Task Review)
-   ARCHIVE Mode: `visual-maps/archive-mode-map.mdc` (Documentation & Closure)

## üíª PLATFORM-SPECIFIC COMMANDS & EFFICIENCY (General Reminder)
*   Always be mindful of platform differences when using `run_terminal_cmd`. Refer to `Core/platform-awareness.mdc` principles.
*   Strive for command efficiency. Refer to `Core/command-execution.mdc` principles.
