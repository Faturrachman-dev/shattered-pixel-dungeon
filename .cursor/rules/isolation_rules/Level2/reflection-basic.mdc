# BASIC REFLECTION FOR LEVEL 2 TASKS (AI Instructions)

> **TL;DR:** This rule guides the creation of a basic reflection document for a completed Level 2 task using `edit_file`. It focuses on key outcomes, challenges, and lessons.

This rule is typically fetched by the Level 2 workflow orchestrator or the main REFLECT mode orchestrator if the task is L2.

## ⚙️ AI ACTIONS FOR LEVEL 2 REFLECTION:

1.  **Acknowledge & Context:**
    a.  State: "Initiating Basic Reflection for Level 2 task: [Task Name from activeContext.md]."
    b.  `read_file memory-bank/tasks.md` for the completed task details (original plan, requirements).
    c.  `read_file memory-bank/progress.md` for the implementation journey and any logged challenges/successes.
    d.  `read_file memory-bank/activeContext.md` to confirm implementation is marked complete.
2.  **Prepare Reflection Content (Based on Template Below):**
    a.  Synthesize information from `tasks.md` and `progress.md`.
3.  **Create Reflection File:**
    a.  Determine reflection filename: `reflect-[task_name_or_id]-[date].md` (e.g., `reflect-user-profile-update-20250515.md`).
    b.  Use `edit_file` to create/update `memory-bank/reflection/[reflection_filename.md]` with the structured content.
        **Basic Reflection Structure (Content for `edit_file`):**
        ```markdown
        # Level 2 Enhancement Reflection: [Feature Name from tasks.md]

        ## Task ID: [Task ID from tasks.md]
        ## Date of Reflection: [Current Date]
        ## Complexity Level: 2

        ## 1. Enhancement Summary
        [Brief one-paragraph summary of the enhancement: What was the goal? What was achieved?]

        ## 2. What Went Well?
        [Identify 2-3 specific positive aspects of the development process for this enhancement.]
        - Success point 1: [e.g., Integration with existing module was straightforward.]
        - Success point 2: [e.g., Testing covered all main use cases effectively.]

        ## 3. Challenges Encountered & Solutions
        [Identify 1-2 specific challenges and how they were addressed.]
        - Challenge 1: [e.g., Initial approach for X was inefficient.]
          - Solution: [e.g., Refactored to use Y pattern, improving performance.]
        - Challenge 2: (if any)

        ## 4. Key Learnings (Technical or Process)
        [List 1-2 key insights or lessons learned.]
        - Learning 1: [e.g., Realized library Z is better suited for this type of UI component.]
        - Learning 2: [e.g., Updating `tasks.md` more frequently for sub-tasks helps maintain clarity.]

        ## 5. Time Estimation Accuracy (If applicable)
        - Estimated time: [From tasks.md, if estimated]
        - Actual time: [Approximate actual time based on progress.md entries]
        - Variance & Reason: [Briefly, e.g., "+2 hours due to unexpected CSS conflict."]

        ## 6. Action Items for Future Work (Optional for L2, but good practice)
        [Any specific, actionable improvements for future tasks or for this feature.]
        - Action item 1: [e.g., Document the new CSS utility class created.]
        ```
4.  **Update Core Memory Bank Files (using `edit_file`):**
    a.  **`tasks.md`:**
        *   Mark the Level 2 task's REFLECT phase as "COMPLETE".
        *   Add a link to the reflection document: `Reflection: ../reflection/[reflection_filename.md]`.
    b.  **`activeContext.md`:**
        *   Update current focus: "Reflection complete for L2 task [Task Name]. Ready for ARCHIVE."
        *   Add to log: "Completed reflection for L2 task [Task Name]. Document at `reflection/[reflection_filename.md]`."
5.  **Completion:**
    a.  State: "Basic reflection for Level 2 task [Task Name] complete. Reflection document created at `memory-bank/reflection/[reflection_filename.md]`."
    b.  (Control returns to the fetching rule, e.g., `Level2/workflow-level2.mdc` or `visual-maps/reflect-mode-map.mdc`).
