# LEVEL 3 ARCHIVE: INTERMEDIATE FEATURE DOCUMENTATION (AI Instructions)

> **TL;DR:** This rule guides the creation of an intermediate archive document for a completed Level 3 feature using `edit_file`. It ensures key information, including links to creative and reflection documents, is preserved.

This rule is typically fetched by the Level 3 workflow orchestrator or the main ARCHIVE mode orchestrator if the task is L3.

## ⚙️ AI ACTIONS FOR LEVEL 3 ARCHIVING:

1.  **Acknowledge & Context:**
    a.  State: "Initiating Intermediate Archiving for Level 3 feature: [Feature Name from activeContext.md]."
    b.  `read_file memory-bank/tasks.md` for the completed feature details (original plan, requirements, links to creative docs).
    c.  `read_file memory-bank/reflection/reflect-[feature_name_or_id]-[date].md` for detailed lessons learned.
    d.  `read_file memory-bank/progress.md` for implementation summary and key milestones.
    e.  `read_file` all relevant `memory-bank/creative/creative-[aspect_name]-[date].md` documents associated with this feature.
2.  **Pre-Archive Checklist (AI Self-Correction):**
    a.  Confirm from `tasks.md` that the REFLECT phase for this L3 feature is marked complete.
    b.  Verify `memory-bank/reflection/reflect-[feature_name_or_id]-[date].md` exists and is finalized.
    c.  Verify all `memory-bank/creative/creative-*.md` documents linked in `tasks.md` for this feature exist.
    d.  If checks fail, state: "L3 ARCHIVE BLOCKED: Prerequisite documents (Reflection, Creative) are missing or incomplete for feature [Feature Name]. Please complete REFLECT / CREATIVE modes first." Await user.
3.  **Prepare Archive Content (Based on Template Below):**
    a.  Synthesize information from all gathered documents.
4.  **Create Archive File:**
    a.  Determine archive filename: `archive-[feature_name_or_id]-[date].md` (e.g., `archive-user-profile-enhancement-20250515.md`).
    b.  Use `edit_file` to create/update `memory-bank/archive/[archive_filename.md]` with the structured content.
        **L3 Archive Structure (Content for `edit_file`):**
        ```markdown

    b.  **`progress.md`:**
        *   Add a final entry: `[Date] - Feature [Feature Name] ARCHIVED. See archive/[archive_filename.md]`.
    c.  **`activeContext.md`:**
        *   Clear current feature focus.
        *   Add to log: "Archived Level 3 feature [Feature Name]. Archive at `archive/[archive_filename.md]`."
6.  **Completion:**
    a.  State: "Intermediate archiving for Level 3 feature [Feature Name] complete. Archive document created at `memory-bank/archive/[archive_filename.md]`."
    b.  (Control returns to the fetching rule).
