# LEVEL 3 INTERMEDIATE TASK TRACKING (AI Instructions)

> **TL;DR:** This rule provides guidelines for structured task tracking in `memory-bank/tasks.md` for Level 3 (Intermediate Feature) tasks. Use `edit_file` to create and maintain this structure.

This rule is typically fetched by the PLAN mode orchestrator (`Level3/planning-comprehensive.mdc` will refer to this structure).

## ‚öôÔ∏è AI ACTIONS FOR LEVEL 3 TASK TRACKING (Structure for `tasks.md`):

When `Level3/planning-comprehensive.mdc` guides you to detail the plan in `tasks.md`, use `edit_file` to ensure the entry for the Level 3 feature includes the following structure.

**Task Entry Template for `tasks.md` (L3 Feature):**
```markdown
## Task: [L3-ID: Feature Name, e.g., L3-001: Implement User Profile Page with Avatar Upload]

- **Status:** [e.g., IN_PROGRESS_PLANNING, PENDING_CREATIVE, IN_PROGRESS_IMPLEMENTATION, etc.]
- **Priority:** [High/Medium/Low]
- **Complexity Level:** 3
- **Assigned To:** AI
- **Target Completion Date (Optional):** [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Links:**
    - Project Brief: `../projectbrief.md`
    - Creative Docs: (List links as they are created, e.g., `../creative/creative-profile-ui-20250515.md`)
    - Reflection Doc: (Link when created)
    - Archive Doc: (Link when created)

### 4. Implementation Strategy & Sub-Tasks
[Break down the high-level steps from `planning-comprehensive.mdc` into more granular, checkable sub-tasks for implementation. Prefix with `IMPL:`]
- **Phase 1: Backend API Development**
  - [ ] IMPL: Define data models for user profile and avatar.
  - [ ] IMPL: Create API endpoint for fetching profile data.
  - [ ] IMPL: Create API endpoint for updating profile data.
  - [ ] IMPL: Create API endpoint for avatar image upload.
  - [ ] IMPL: Write unit tests for API endpoints.
- **Phase 2: Frontend UI Development**
  - [ ] IMPL: Build profile display component.
  - [ ] IMPL: Build profile edit form component.
  - [ ] IMPL: Implement avatar upload UI.
  - [ ] IMPL: Integrate frontend components with backend APIs.
  - [ ] IMPL: Write component tests for UI.
- **Phase 3: Testing & Refinement**
  - [ ] IMPL: Perform integration testing.
  - [ ] IMPL: Address any bugs found.
  - [ ] IMPL: Code review and cleanup.

```

## üîÑ PROGRESS TRACKING (AI Actions during IMPLEMENT, REFLECT, etc.)
*   As sub-tasks (IMPL, CREATIVE, etc.) are completed, use `edit_file` to mark them `[x]` in `tasks.md`.
*   Update the main `Status:` field of the L3 task entry.
*   Update the `Checkpoints & Phase Gates` section as each major phase concludes.
*   Log detailed activities in `memory-bank/progress.md`.

**Key Principle:** `tasks.md` for L3 features should be a living document, meticulously updated via `edit_file` to reflect the comprehensive plan and ongoing progress through all CMB modes.
