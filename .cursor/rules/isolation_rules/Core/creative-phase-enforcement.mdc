# CREATIVE PHASE ENFORCEMENT

> **TL;DR:** For L3/L4 tasks, if `tasks.md` flags items for "CREATIVE Phase", they MUST be completed before IMPLEMENT.

## üîç ENFORCEMENT WORKFLOW (AI Actions)
(Typically invoked by IMPLEMENT mode orchestrator for L3/L4 tasks, or by PLAN mode before suggesting IMPLEMENT)

1.  **Check Task Level & Creative Flags:**
    a.  `read_file` `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (for task level).
    b.  `read_file` `memory-bank/tasks.md`. Scan current feature's sub-tasks for incomplete "CREATIVE: Design..." entries.
2.  **Decision:**
    *   **If uncompleted CREATIVE tasks for L3/L4 feature:**
        a.  State: "üö® IMPLEMENTATION BLOCKED for [feature]. Creative designs needed for: [list uncompleted creative tasks]."
        b.  Suggest: "Initiate CREATIVE mode (e.g., 'CREATIVE design [component]')." Await user.
    *   **Else (No uncompleted creative tasks or not L3/L4):**
        a.  State: "Creative phase requirements met/not applicable. Proceeding."
