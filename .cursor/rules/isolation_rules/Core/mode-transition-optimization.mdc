# MODE TRANSITION OPTIMIZATION (AI Actions)

> **TL;DR:** Efficient mode transitions are achieved by updating `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (via `edit_file`) before a transition. The next mode's orchestrator rule then reads this file for context.

## ðŸ”„ CONTEXT TRANSFER PROCESS (AI Actions):

1.  **Before Current Mode Exits (or suggests exiting):**
    a.  Your current instructions (from main prompt or an `.mdc` via `fetch_rules`) will guide you to use `edit_file` to update `memory-bank/activeContext.md`.
    b.  This update should include a section like:
        ```markdown
        ## Mode Transition Prepared - [Timestamp]
        - **From Mode:** [Current Mode, e.g., PLAN]
        - **To Mode Recommended:** [Target Mode, e.g., CREATIVE or IMPLEMENT]
        - **Current Task Focus:** [Specific task name or ID from tasks.md]
        - **Key Outputs/Decisions from [Current Mode]:**
            - [Summary of what was achieved, e.g., "Plan for user authentication feature is complete."]
            - [Reference to key artifacts created/updated, e.g., "See `memory-bank/tasks.md` for detailed sub-tasks. Creative design needed for UI components."]
        - **Primary Goal for [Target Mode]:** [What the next mode should focus on, e.g., "Design UI mockups for login and registration pages."]
        ```
2.  **When New Mode Starts:**
    a.  The new mode's main custom prompt (in Cursor's Advanced Settings) will instruct you to `fetch_rules` for its primary orchestrating `.mdc` file (e.g., `visual-maps/creative-mode-map.mdc`).
    b.  That orchestrating `.mdc` will (as an early step) instruct you to `read_file memory-bank/activeContext.md` to understand the incoming context, task focus, and goals.

**Key Principle:** `memory-bank/activeContext.md` is the primary "handover document" between modes, managed by `edit_file`. Keep its "Mode Transition Prepared" section concise and actionable for the next mode.
