# TASK COMPLEXITY DETERMINATION

> **TL;DR:** This rule guides you to determine task complexity (Level 1-4). Based on the level, you will then be instructed to `fetch_rules` for the corresponding primary mode map.

## üå≥ COMPLEXITY DECISION TREE (Conceptual for AI)
**Textual Guide for AI:**
Based on user's request and initial analysis (e.g., from `read_file` on `README.md`):

1.  **Bug fix/error correction?**
    *   **Yes:** Single, isolated component? -> **Level 1 (Quick Bug Fix)**
    *   **Yes:** Multiple components, straightforward fix? -> **Level 2 (Simple Enhancement/Refactor)**
    *   **Yes:** Complex interactions, architectural impact? -> **Level 3 (Intermediate Feature/Bug)**
    *   **No (new feature/enhancement):**
        *   Small, self-contained addition? -> **Level 2 (Simple Enhancement)**
        *   Complete new feature, multiple components, needs design? -> **Level 3 (Intermediate Feature)**
        *   System-wide, major subsystem, deep architectural design? -> **Level 4 (Complex System)**

## üìù ACTION: DOCUMENT & ANNOUNCE COMPLEXITY

1.  **Determine Level:** Decide Level 1, 2, 3, or 4.
2.  **Document in `activeContext.md`:** Use `edit_file` to update `memory-bank/activeContext.md`:
    ```markdown
    ## Task Complexity Assessment
    - Task: [User's request]
    - Determined Complexity: Level [1/2/3/4] - [Name]
    - Rationale: [Justification]
    ```
3.  **Update `tasks.md`:** Use `edit_file` to update `memory-bank/tasks.md` with the level, e.g., `Level 3: Implement user auth`.
4.  **Announce & Next Step:**
    *   State: "Assessed as Level [N]: [Name]."
    *   **Level 1:** "Proceeding with Level 1 workflow. Will `fetch_rules` for `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Level1/workflow-level1.mdc` (or directly to IMPLEMENT map if simple enough, e.g., `visual-maps/implement-mode-map.mdc` which might then fetch a Level 1 implement rule)."
    *   **Level 2-4:** "Requires detailed planning. Transitioning to PLAN mode. Will `fetch_rules` for `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/visual-maps/plan-mode-map.mdc`."
