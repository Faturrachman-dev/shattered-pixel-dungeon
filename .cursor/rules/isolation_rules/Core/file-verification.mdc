# OPTIMIZED FILE VERIFICATION & CREATION SYSTEM (Memory Bank Setup)

> **TL;DR:** Verify/create essential Memory Bank directories and files. Use `edit_file` to create/populate files, `run_terminal_cmd` (platform-aware) for `mkdir`. Log actions.

## ⚙️ AI ACTIONS FOR MEMORY BANK SETUP (Typically during early VAN)

1.  **Acknowledge:** State: "Performing Memory Bank file verification and setup."
2.  **Reference Paths:** Mentally (or by `read_file` if necessary) refer to `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Core/memory-bank-paths.mdc` for canonical paths.
3.  **Verify/Create `memory-bank/` Root Directory:**
    a.  Use `list_dir .` (project root) to check if `memory-bank/` exists.
    b.  If missing:
        i.  `run_terminal_cmd` (platform-aware, e.g., `mkdir memory-bank` or `New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path memory-bank`).
        ii. Verify creation (e.g., `list_dir .` again).
4.  **Verify/Create Core Subdirectories in `memory-bank/`:**
    a.  The subdirectories are: `creative/`, `reflection/`, `archive/`.
    b.  For each (e.g., `creative`):
        i.  `list_dir memory-bank/` to check if `memory-bank/creative/` exists.
        ii. If missing: `run_terminal_cmd` (e.g., `mkdir memory-bank/creative`). Verify.
5.  **Verify/Create Core `.md` Files in `memory-bank/` (Using `edit_file`):**
    a.  The core files are: `tasks.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `style-guide.md`.
    b.  For each file (e.g., `tasks.md`):
        i.  Attempt to `read_file memory-bank/tasks.md`.
        ii. If it fails (file doesn't exist) or content is empty/default placeholder:
            Use `edit_file memory-bank/tasks.md` to write an initial template. Example for `tasks.md`:
            ```markdown
            # Memory Bank: Tasks

            ## Current Task
            - Task ID: T000
            - Name: [Task not yet defined]
            - Status: PENDING_INITIALIZATION
            - Complexity: Not yet assessed
            - Assigned To: AI

            ## Backlog
            (Empty)
            ```
            *(Provide similar minimal templates for other core files if creating them anew. `activeContext.md` could start with `# Active Context - Initialized [Timestamp]`).*
        iii. Optionally, `read_file memory-bank/tasks.md` again to confirm content.
6.  **Log Verification Actions:**
    a.  Use `edit_file` to append a summary to `memory-bank/activeContext.md` under a "File Verification Log" heading. List directories/files checked, created, or found existing. Note any errors.
    b.  Example log entry:
        ```markdown
        ### File Verification Log - [Timestamp]
        - Checked/Created `memory-bank/` directory.
        - Checked/Created `memory-bank/creative/` directory.
        - Checked/Created `memory-bank/tasks.md` (initial template written).
        - ... (other files/dirs) ...
        - Status: All essential Memory Bank structures verified/created.
        ```
7.  **Completion:** State: "Memory Bank file structure verification and setup complete."
