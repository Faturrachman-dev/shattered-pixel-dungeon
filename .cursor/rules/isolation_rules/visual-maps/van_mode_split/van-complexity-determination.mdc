# VAN MODE: COMPLEXITY DETERMINATION (Placeholder - Logic Moved)

> **TL;DR:** This rule is a placeholder. The primary task complexity determination logic has been consolidated into `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Core/complexity-decision-tree.mdc`.

## ⚙️ AI ACTION:

1.  **Acknowledge:** State: "Note: `van_mode_split/van-complexity-determination.mdc` is a placeholder. The main complexity determination logic is in `Core/complexity-decision-tree.mdc`."
2.  **Guidance:** If you were instructed to determine task complexity, you should have been (or should be) directed to `fetch_rules` for `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Core/complexity-decision-tree.mdc`.

(Control returns to the fetching rule, likely `van-mode-map.mdc` which should fetch the Core rule directly).
