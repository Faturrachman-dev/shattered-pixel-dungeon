# VAN QA: MODE TRANSITIONS (AI Instructions)

> **TL;DR:** Handles mode transition recommendations after VAN QA validation. If QA passed, recommend BUILD mode. This rule is fetched by `van-qa-main.mdc` after a successful QA.

## ‚öôÔ∏è AI ACTIONS FOR MODE TRANSITION (POST QA SUCCESS):

1.  **Acknowledge:** State: "VAN QA validation passed successfully."
2.  **Update `activeContext.md`:**
    a.  Use `edit_file` to update `memory-bank/activeContext.md` with:
        ```markdown
        ## VAN QA Status - [Timestamp]
        - Overall Result: PASS
        - Next Recommended Mode: BUILD
        ```
3.  **Recommend BUILD Mode:**
    a.  State: "All technical pre-flight checks are green. The project appears ready for implementation."
    b.  State: "Recommend transitioning to BUILD mode. Type 'BUILD' to begin implementation."
4.  **Await User Confirmation:** Await the user to type 'BUILD' or another command.

## üîí BUILD MODE ACCESS (Conceptual Reminder for AI):
*   The system is designed such that if a user tries to enter 'BUILD' mode directly without VAN QA having passed (for tasks requiring it), the BUILD mode orchestrator (or a preceding check) should ideally verify the `.qa_validation_status` file or `activeContext.md` and block if QA was needed but not passed. This current rule (`mode-transitions.mdc`) focuses on the *recommendation* after a *successful* QA.
