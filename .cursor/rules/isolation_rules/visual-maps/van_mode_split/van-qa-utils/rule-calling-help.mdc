# VAN QA: HOW TO CALL RULES (Quick Syntax Reminder)

> **TL;DR:** This provides a very basic syntax reminder for using `fetch_rules`. You generally won't need to fetch this rule; it's a developer note.

## ⚙️ `fetch_rules` SYNTAX REMINDER:

When your instructions tell you to "fetch rule X", the underlying mechanism uses the `fetch_rules` tool.

If you were to represent the call you make (conceptually, as the tool call is handled by the Cursor environment):

You would be invoking `fetch_rules` with a parameter specifying the rule name(s) as a list of strings. For a single rule:

```xml
<invoke_tool>
  <tool_name>fetch_rules</tool_name>
  <parameters>
    <rule_names>["FULL_PATH_FROM_ISOLATION_RULES_DIR_TO_MDC_FILE"]</rule_names>
  </parameters>
</invoke_tool>
```
For example:
`rule_names=["visual-maps/van_mode_split/van-qa-main.mdc"]`
(Assuming the system resolves this relative to `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/`)

**You typically don't construct this XML. You just follow the instruction "fetch rule X" and the system handles the invocation.** The key is providing the correct, full path to the `.mdc` file as specified in the instructions.
