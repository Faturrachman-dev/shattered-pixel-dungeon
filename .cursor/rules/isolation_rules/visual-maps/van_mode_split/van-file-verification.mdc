# VAN MODE: FILE VERIFICATION (Placeholder - Logic Moved)

> **TL;DR:** This rule is a placeholder. The primary Memory Bank file verification and creation logic has been consolidated into `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Core/file-verification.mdc`.

## ⚙️ AI ACTION:

1.  **Acknowledge:** State: "Note: `van_mode_split/van-file-verification.mdc` is a placeholder. The main file verification logic is in `Core/file-verification.mdc`."
2.  **Guidance:** If you were instructed to perform initial Memory Bank file verification, you should have been (or should be) directed to `fetch_rules` for `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Core/file-verification.mdc`.

(Control returns to the fetching rule, likely `van-mode-map.mdc` which should fetch the Core rule directly).
