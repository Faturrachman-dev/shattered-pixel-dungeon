# CREATIVE PHASE: UI/UX DESIGN GUIDELINES (AI Instructions)

> **TL;DR:** This rule guides you through designing and documenting UI/UX solutions. CRITICAL: Check for and adhere to `memory-bank/style-guide.md`. If missing, prompt user to create/link it. Document decisions in `memory-bank/creative/creative-uiux-[component_name]-[date].md` using `edit_file` and the `optimized-creative-template.mdc` structure.

This rule is typically fetched by `visual-maps/creative-mode-map.mdc` when a UI/UX design task is active.

## ⚙️ AI ACTIONS FOR UI/UX DESIGN:

1.  **Acknowledge & Context:**
    a.  State: "Initiating CREATIVE phase for UI/UX Design: [Component/Feature from tasks.md]."
    b.  `read_file memory-bank/tasks.md` for specific UI/UX requirements, user stories, and scope.
    c.  `read_file memory-bank/activeContext.md` for overall project context.
    d.  `read_file .cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Phases/CreativePhase/optimized-creative-template.mdc` to understand the documentation structure.
2.  **Style Guide Integration (CRITICAL):**
    a.  **Check Primary Location:** `read_file memory-bank/style-guide.md`.
    b.  **If Found:** State "Style guide `memory-bank/style-guide.md` loaded. All UI/UX proposals will adhere to it." Proceed to step 3.
    c.  **If NOT Found at Primary Location:**
        i.  Prompt User: "Style guide `memory-bank/style-guide.md` not found. Is there an existing style guide at a different path or URL? If so, please provide it. Otherwise, I can help create a basic one now, or we can proceed without (not recommended for new UI)." Await user response.
        ii. **If User Provides Path/URL:** Attempt to `read_file [user_provided_path]` or conceptually access URL. If successful, state "Style guide loaded from [source]. All UI/UX proposals will adhere to it." Proceed to step 3. If fails, revert to "Style guide not available."
        iii. **If User Opts to Create:**
            1.  State: "Okay, let's define a basic style guide in `memory-bank/style-guide.md`. Please provide preferences for: Core Color Palette (primary, secondary, accent, neutrals, status colors - hex codes if possible), Typography (font families, sizes, weights for headings/body), Spacing System (base unit, Tailwind scale usage if known), Key Component Styles (buttons, inputs - general look/feel or Tailwind examples)."
            2.  Based on user input (or analysis of provided examples like screenshots if user offers them), generate content for `memory-bank/style-guide.md`. (Example structure: Headings for Colors, Typography, Spacing, Components; list defined styles under each).
            3.  Use `edit_file` to create and save this content to `memory-bank/style-guide.md`.
            4.  State: "Basic style guide created at `memory-bank/style-guide.md`. All UI/UX proposals will adhere to it." Proceed to step 3.
        iv. **If User Opts to Proceed Without:** State: "Proceeding with UI/UX design without a style guide. WARNING: This may lead to inconsistencies. I will aim for internal consistency within this component." Proceed to step 3.
3.  **Define Problem & UI/UX Requirements (Section 1 of `optimized-creative-template.mdc`):**
    a.  Clearly state the UI/UX problem (e.g., "Design an intuitive interface for user registration").
    b.  List key user stories/goals for this UI (e.g., "As a new user, I want to register quickly with minimal fields").
    c.  List functional requirements for the UI (e.g., "Must include fields for email, password, confirm password").
    d.  List relevant NFRs (e.g., "Must be responsive," "Adhere to WCAG AA accessibility").
    e.  Note any constraints (e.g., "Must use existing React component library X if possible").
4.  **Explore UI/UX Options (Section 2 & 3 of `optimized-creative-template.mdc`):**
    a.  Propose 2-3 distinct UI/UX solutions. For each, describe:
        *   Layout and structure (Information Architecture).
        *   Key interaction patterns (User Flows).
        *   Visual design approach (referencing `style-guide.md` elements like colors, fonts, spacing, component styles. If no style guide, describe choices made for consistency).
        *   How it addresses user needs and requirements.
    b.  Analyze options considering usability, A11y, feasibility (React/Tailwind), aesthetics, and **strict adherence to `style-guide.md` if available.**
5.  **Make Decision & Justify (Section 4 of `optimized-creative-template.mdc`):**
    a.  Select the most suitable UI/UX solution.
    b.  Provide clear rationale, referencing the style guide and how the chosen design meets user needs and requirements effectively.
6.  **Outline Implementation Guidelines (Section 5 of `optimized-creative-template.mdc`):**
    a.  Describe key React components to be built/used.
    b.  Suggest specific Tailwind CSS utility classes or custom CSS (if extending Tailwind per style guide) for styling key elements.
    c.  Note important states (hover, focus, disabled, error) and how they should appear (per style guide).
    d.  Mention responsive design considerations (breakpoints, mobile-first approach if applicable, per style guide).
7.  **Document in `creative-uiux-*.md`:**
    a.  Determine filename: `creative-uiux-[component_name_or_feature]-[date].md`.
    b.  Use `edit_file` to create/update `memory-bank/creative/[filename]` with all the above, structured per `optimized-creative-template.mdc`.
8.  **Update Core Memory Bank Files:**
    a.  Use `edit_file` to update `memory-bank/tasks.md`:
        *   Mark "CREATIVE: Design UI/UX for [component/feature]" sub-task as complete.
        *   Link to the created `creative-uiux-*.md` document.
    b.  Use `edit_file` to add a summary of the UI/UX decision to "Creative Decisions Log" in `memory-bank/activeContext.md`.
9.  **Completion:**
    a.  State: "UI/UX design for [Component/Feature] complete. Documented in `memory-bank/creative/[filename]`. Adherence to style guide `memory-bank/style-guide.md` [was maintained / was attempted due to no guide existing]."
    b.  (Control returns to `visual-maps/creative-mode-map.mdc`).
