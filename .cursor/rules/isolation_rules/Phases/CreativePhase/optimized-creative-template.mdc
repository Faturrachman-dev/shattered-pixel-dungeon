# OPTIMIZED CREATIVE PHASE TEMPLATE (Structure for `creative-*.md` files)

> **TL;DR:** This rule provides a structured template for documenting outputs of a creative phase (e.g., architecture, UI/UX, algorithm design). Use this structure when `edit_file` is used to create or update a `memory-bank/creative/creative-[aspect_name]-[date].md` document.

## üìù PROGRESSIVE DOCUMENTATION MODEL (Principle for AI)
*   Start with concise summaries for problem and options.
*   Provide detailed analysis primarily for the selected option(s) or when comparing top contenders.
*   This keeps the document focused and token-efficient initially, allowing for expansion if needed.

## üìã TEMPLATE STRUCTURE (Guide for `edit_file` content)

```markdown
üìå CREATIVE PHASE START: [Specific Aspect Being Designed, e.g., User Authentication Module Architecture]
Date: [Current Date]
Related Task ID (from tasks.md): [Task ID]
Designer: AI

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ PROBLEM DEFINITION
- **Description:** [Clear and concise description of the specific problem this design phase addresses. What needs to be designed or decided?]
- **Key Requirements (Functional & Non-Functional):**
  - [ ] Requirement 1: [e.g., System must support JWT-based authentication.]
  - [ ] Requirement 2: [e.g., Token validation must occur within 50ms.]
  - [ ] Requirement 3: [e.g., Design must allow for future integration with OAuth providers.]
- **Constraints:** [Any technical, business, or resource constraints impacting design choices. e.g., Must use existing PostgreSQL database for user store.]

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ OPTIONS EXPLORED
[List 2-3 viable options considered. Provide a brief one-line description for each.]
- **Option A:** [Name of Option A, e.g., Monolithic Auth Service] - [One-line description]
- **Option B:** [Name of Option B, e.g., Microservice for Auth with API Gateway] - [One-line description]
- **Option C:** [Name of Option C, e.g., Leverage Third-Party Auth Provider (Auth0/Okta)] - [One-line description]

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ ANALYSIS OF OPTIONS
[Provide a comparative analysis. A table is good for summaries. Detailed pros/cons for each option can follow, especially for top contenders or the chosen one.]

**Summary Comparison Table:**
| Criterion         | Option A: [Name] | Option B: [Name] | Option C: [Name] |
|-------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Scalability       | [e.g., Medium]   | [e.g., High]     | [e.g., High]     |
| Complexity        | [e.g., Low]      | [e.g., Medium]   | [e.g., Low-Med]  |
| Development Effort| [e.g., Low]      | [e.g., High]     | [e.g., Medium]   |
| Maintainability   | [e.g., Medium]   | [e.g., Medium]   | [e.g., High (external)] |
| Cost (Operational)| [e.g., Low]      | [e.g., Medium]   | [e.g., Potentially High] |
| Security (Control)| [e.g., High]     | [e.g., High]     | [e.g., Medium (dependency)] |
| Alignment w/ Reqs | [e.g., Good]     | [e.g., Excellent]| [e.g., Good, some gaps] |

**Detailed Analysis (Focus on top 1-2 options or as requested):**

<details>
  <summary>Detailed Analysis: Option B: Microservice for Auth</summary>

  **Description:**
  [Detailed description of how Option B works, key components involved, data flows, etc.]

  **Pros:**
  - Pro 1: [e.g., Independent scalability of auth service.]
  - Pro 2: [e.g., Clear separation of concerns, improving maintainability of other services.]

  **Cons:**
  - Con 1: [e.g., Increased operational complexity due to distributed system.]
  - Con 2: [e.g., Potential for network latency between services.]

  **Implementation Complexity:** [Low/Medium/High]
  [Explanation of complexity factors specific to this option.]

  **Resource Requirements:**
  [Details on specific resource needs: e.g., separate database, more compute instances.]

  **Risk Assessment:**
  [Analysis of risks specific to this option: e.g., inter-service communication failures.]
</details>

*(Repeat `<details>` block for other significantly considered options if necessary)*

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ DECISION & RATIONALE
- **Selected Option:** [Clearly state the chosen option, e.g., Option B: Microservice for Auth with API Gateway]
- **Rationale:** [Provide a detailed justification for why this option was selected over others. Refer to the analysis, requirements, and constraints. e.g., "Option B was chosen despite higher initial complexity due to its superior scalability and alignment with our long-term microservices strategy. It best meets NFR for scalability and maintainability..."]

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES (for the selected option)
[Provide high-level guidelines, key considerations, or next steps for implementing the chosen design. This is not the full implementation plan but pointers for the IMPLEMENT phase.]
- [Guideline 1: e.g., Define clear API contracts for the new auth service using OpenAPI spec.]
- [Guideline 2: e.g., Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms for inter-service calls.]
- [Guideline 3: e.g., Ensure comprehensive logging and monitoring for the auth service.]
- [Guideline 4: e.g., Key technologies to use: Spring Boot for service, JWT for tokens, PostgreSQL for user data.]
- [Guideline 5: e.g., First implementation phase should focus on core token generation and validation.]
